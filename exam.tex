An example exam, January 28, 2019. \\

For each of the nine lectures there are six questions, yielding $9 \times 6 =54$ questions in total. Every question counts equally. There is one correct answer for each question. Mark the answer on the answer sheet (note the ordering of the A,B,C,D options). Closed book exam: No books, notes, phones, etc allowed. Good luck!
