Lecture 1;Histograms and color;"Consider these color pairs: RGB(1, 0, 0)-HSI(0, 1, 1); RGB(1, 1, 1)-HSI(0, 0, 1); RGB(0, 0, 0)-HSI(0, 0, 1); RGB(0, 0, 1)-HSI(0, 1, 1/3). How many pairs represents the same color?";Only 1 pair;2 pairs;3 pairs;All 4 pairs;Option A;
Lecture 1;Histograms and color;Using point processing on pixels with a typical 8-bit per channel RGB encoding, which operations do we need to apply to each channel to obtain an image with inverted colours? (x is the pixel from the input image);Subtract 255 from x;Multiply x by -1 and add (255*3);Multiply x by -1 and add 255;Subtract 128 from x;Option C;
